Install Jetifier npm install --save-dev jetifier or yarn add -D jetifier
Edit your package.json and add a postinstall script: "postinstall": "npx jetify", like so:
"scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npx jetify"
   ...
}    
Run npm install or yarn
At the end of install you should see something like:
$ npx jetify
Jetifier found N file(s) to forward-jetify. Using X workers...`. 
This means it's working. The project should compile fine now.
This way jetfier will "upgrade" all deps to use AndroidX. This step has to be repeated after each installation, hence the "postinstall" step.
